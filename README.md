# Quick Cal (Java)
### Description:
After the completion of my Java college course i decided to test my skills by creating a calculator using java GUI. I initially considered the project to be a breeze as it sounded so basic. However, i quickly realized that i was breaking down the problem using human approaches and not computer logics. The Phrase "How does the computer know ...." became my lingo over the project. I had to divide teh user input into signs and numbers and take the required action with each entered item. between juggling between classes and free time it took a total of a month to complete.

### How To Install:
* Simply clone the github repository using any IDE that supports java
* After cloning the repository, wait for the project to build 
* Once the project is done building and compiling, simply run the program

### Usage
* Unlike the standard calculator that comes with Windows, this alternative open-source application can be customized to meet the specific needs of any user.
### Tools and Framework
* Java
* Java GUI
